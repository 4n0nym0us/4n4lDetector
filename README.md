4n4lDetector is an analysis tool for Microsoft Windows executable files, libraries, drivers and mdumps for x86 and x64. As of v1.8 an extended use for analyzing anomalies in Linux ELF executables was also included. Its main objective is to collect the necessary information to facilitate the identification of malicious code inside the analyzed files. This tool analyzes, among other things, the PE header and its structure, the content of the sections, the different types of strings, among many other things. It also incorporates a multitude of its own ideas to recognize anomalies in the construction of files and the detection of mechanisms used by current malware.<br>

  [+] UPX compression version detector updated.<br>
  [+] The "Emails" module is included as (optional disabled) by default, due to the delay it could cause in some rare binaries.<br>

       -> Options for modifying the title and content of the report<br>
       -> A viewer of the generated HTML code for display<br>
       -> A button to save the report to a document<br>
       -> Integrated a button to open the folder that houses all the saved reports<br>
  [+] Added the "-HTML" parameter for extracting reports in HTML format by console:<br>

<h3>v1.7</h3>
  [+] Added new functionality to identify ASLR-enabled binaries.<br>
  [+] Fixed a bug that could lead to the application crashing in some binaries.<br>
  [+] Improved the integration of the debugger for reading the Entry Point of the x86 binaries.<br>
  [+] Smoothed out the design of the form interface and repositioning of controls.<br>
  [+] The process execution functionality is eliminated, although the possibility of analyzing MDUMPS is maintained.<br>
<h3>v1.6</h3>
  [+] Added new functionality to view the Entry Point code in ASM for x86 binary.<br>
  [+] Added combined rules for strings in hexadecimal and text, with multiple matches.<br>
      -> The end of the rule description field contains the rule number separated by "-" from the total number of rules belonging to the same combination.<br>
         Example: H:1A6C6488F2736988:Rich Signature Found 1-2<br>
         (Currently it only allows a maximum of 9 matches...) ;)<br>
